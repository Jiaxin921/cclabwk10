                <strong>Coffee</strong> is the avatar I chose. Coffee is something that makes me feel more sober and concentrated. After having a cup of coffee, I feel like I am ready to do things afterwards. Having a cup of coffee is kind of a routine, which indicate that there is something important in progress.

            <p class="intro">
                In New York, there are uncountable coffee shops, which are very attractive and unique. I enjoy visiting different coffee shops and spending my time this way.

                In this code sketch, I place 5 ice cubes in 2 different colors to show that some are floating on the coffee and some are not. There are 3 ice cubes filled with (237, 233, 221) color, and 2 filled with (179, 143, 119). There are also some circles of different sizes, which shows air bubbles floating in the coffee. The choice of color is the key point of this code sketch. Based on some simple geometric figures, the brownish color indicates coffee, which lets viewers directly recognize that this might be a cup of latte. My mom gave me feedback that she can tell this is a cup of latte, so I think my choose of color is fine. I also carefully manage the value of the rim color to make it more realistic.

                This artwork is based on a photo that I took last semester. I like how the dark background blends with the brown color that the coffee. Also, watching the process of ice cubes slowly melting inside of coffee is very soothing.

                I made this digital artwork through coding using p5.js. The reason I choose to use coding is that this is a new area for me to learn, and I would like to be more familiar with this new platform. I would love to add more details as I get more skillful at using the p5.js.

            <h2>Future Bio ( in ten years )</h2>
            <p>
                Jiaxin Yu is one of my best friends from Shenzhen, China. She enjoys reading and writing journals as a good way of spending her time. She loves to document her life through photographs. Nearly every piece of artwork she made is inspired by her daily life. After Jiaxin graduated from Parsons School of Design, she pursued her master's degree and let herself become more professional in art and design area. She spent most of her time focusing on her portfolio, and after 3 years she finally had her portfolio ready and attend a university. In her 20s, She has traveled to most of the European countries and finally decided to settle down in one. Big cities have more delicious meals and better transportation, but small cities have a more relaxing atmosphere. Finally, she decide to stay in the small city. The styled architecture and relaxing atmosphere in that city are what she is attracted to. She says that landscapes and architecture are the 2 things she gets most of her inspiration.
